Tragedy of the COâ‚‚mmons
=======================

A simple demo app to test our algorithms before putting them on a smart contract.

What's in here
--------------

A simple flask server that mocks our smart contract (plus its infrastructure),
and a React Native app still to be developed to play with it.

A Postman collection shows a list of calls that can be made to the server.

Dependencies
------------

To run the flask app you'll need to install [redis][https://redis.io/], and run
the usual

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
